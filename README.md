# Home_Sales


This project leverages PySpark and Spark SQL within Jupyter notebook to analyze and derive essential insights from real estate sales data. The focus of the analysis involves the utilization of Spark functionalities to establish temporary views, partition data, and efficiently manage temporary tables through caching and uncaching.

Key Metrics Explored:

Average Four-Bedroom House Price by Year:


Calculated the annual average price for four-bedroom houses, providing insights into the trend of such properties over time.


Average Home Price by Year, Built with Three Bedrooms and Three Bathrooms:
Investigated the average price of homes based on their construction year, specifically those featuring three bedrooms and three bathrooms.


Average Home Price by Year, Meeting Specific Criteria:
Explored the average price of homes constructed each year, considering attributes such as three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and a minimum size of 2,000 square feet.


"View" Rating for Homes Valued at $350,000 or More:
Determined the "view" rating associated with homes surpassing or equaling a $350,000 price threshold, offering insights into the relationship between property value and perceived view quality.


This project showcases the versatility of PySpark and Spark SQL for in-depth analysis of real estate data, providing valuable metrics to inform decision-making and gain a comprehensive understanding of the housing market dynamics.
